# Personal-Medical-Cost-Drivers

This project aimed to investigate the relationship between smoking status, BMI, and insurance charges across different age groups. Through exploratory data analysis, linear regression, ANOVA, and cluster analysis we found significant effects of smoking and age on insurance charges.

## Tools & Techniques: 

* Python (numpy, pandas, seaborn  matplotlib, scipy, stats, statsmodels)
* Tools (Linear Regression, ANOVA, Cluster Analysis)
* Model evaluation were checked for ANOVA using Independence of Samples, Normality or Large Sample Size or No Extreme Outliers or Strong Skewness.
* For The linear regression model validity I checked the linearity, normality of residuals, No Multicollinearity and independence of errors 

## Dataset:

Insurance cost Forecast using Linear Regression provided on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance/data

## Key Findings:

Smoking Status: Smokers consistently incurred significantly higher insurance charges compared to non-smokers across all age groups.

Age: Age was also a significant factor. Older individuals, particularly seniors, tended to have higher insurance charges than younger adults.

BMI: While BMI also showed a positive association with insurance charges, the effect was less pronounced compared to smoking and age.

## Implications:

Insurance providers can use these findings to develop more accurate pricing models and risk assessments. Public health initiatives aimed at reducing smoking rates and promoting healthy lifestyles could lead to lower healthcare costs. Policymakers might consider implementing stricter regulations on tobacco products and promoting preventive healthcare measures to address the impact of smoking and obesity on insurance costs.
