This project aimed to investigate the relationship between smoking status, BMI, and insurance charges across different age groups. Through exploratory data analysis, linear regression, ANOVA, and cluster analysis we found significant effects of smoking and age on insurance charges.

Key Findings:

Smoking Status: Smokers consistently incurred significantly higher insurance charges compared to non-smokers across all age groups.

Age: Age was also a significant factor. Older individuals, particularly seniors, tended to have higher insurance charges than younger adults.

BMI: While BMI also showed a positive association with insurance charges, the effect was less pronounced compared to smoking and age.

Implications:

Insurance providers can use these findings to develop more accurate pricing models and risk assessments. Public health initiatives aimed at reducing smoking rates and promoting healthy lifestyles could lead to lower healthcare costs. Policymakers might consider implementing stricter regulations on tobacco products and promoting preventive healthcare measures to address the impact of smoking and obesity on insurance costs.
